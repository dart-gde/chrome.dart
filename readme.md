# chrome.dart

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/dart-gde/chrome.dart/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/dart-gde/chrome.dart/latest)

### Description

A team effort to create interop with the [chrome.* APIs](http://developer.chrome.com/trunk/apps/api_index.html) used for [Chrome Packaged Apps](http://developer.chrome.com/trunk/apps/about_apps.html).

### Using

```
import 'package:chrome/chrome.dart';
```

The best results will happen when compiling to javascript with the following command. 

```
dart2js --verbose --disallow-unsafe-eval -o<name>.dart.js <name>.dart
```

Check out the [example](example) folder on setup. 

### Using in dartium

It is possible to run a dart chrome app in dartium within the dartvm. Chrome apps do not like having sym links outside of there project folder. One solution is to clone the package dependencies and breaking the symlinks. Something like the following might work.

```
pub install
cd <project_name>/packages/
rsync -RLr . ../packages_snapshots
cd ../
rm -rf packages
mv packages_snapshots packages
```

Then you can `cp -r` the `packages` to the containing chrome app package directory. 

### Building unit tests and loading

* Run `./bin/hop test_dart2js`. 
* Open chrome to `chrome://extensions/`. 
* Click `developer mode`  
* `Load unpacked extensionâ€¦` to `chrome.dart/test`.
